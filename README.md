# Visualizing-NYCRentPricing-covid
This notebook will attempt to answer: What is the most expensive borough and neighborhoods to rent in New York City, if any, while also examining if the COVID-19 period has affected the rental price? The notebook will utilize NYC rental data available on StreetEasy to attempt to answer the questions mentioned. 


The cost of living is such an important topic to examine because generalizing New York City, as a whole, as one of the most expensive cities in the world can be misleading. Individuals should know that living in NYC is not a one size fits all experience. It is especially important to analyze the rental pricing for all of New York City during the COVID period because in a time where the economy has been impacted negatively, itâ€™s crucial to investigate the living pricings patterns in a city that was devastated greatly by the virus.
